# Day 11 – SQL Practice

## Problem Statement
𝐌𝐮𝐬𝐭 𝐓𝐫𝐲: Nvidia, Microsoft (Medium Level) hashtag#SQL Interview Question — Solution

Find the number of transactions that occurred for each product. Output the product name along with the corresponding number of transactions and order records by the product id in ascending order. You can ignore products without transactions.

🔍 By solving this, you'll learn how to use join with grouping. Give it a try and share the output! 👇

CREATE TABLE excel_sql_inventory_data (product_id INT,product_name VARCHAR(50),product_type VARCHAR(50),unit VARCHAR(20),price_unit FLOAT,wholesale FLOAT,current_inventory INT);

INSERT INTO excel_sql_inventory_data (product_id, product_name, product_type, unit, price_unit, wholesale, current_inventory) 
VALUES(1, 'strawberry', 'produce', 'lb', 3.28, 1.77, 13),(2, 'apple_fuji', 'produce', 'lb', 1.44, 0.43, 2),(3, 'orange', 'produce', 'lb', 1.02, 0.37, 2),(4, 'clementines', 'produce', 'lb', 1.19, 0.44, 44),(5, 'blood_orange', 'produce', 'lb', 3.86, 1.66, 19);

CREATE TABLE excel_sql_transaction_data (transaction_id INT PRIMARY KEY,time DATETIME,product_id INT);

INSERT INTO excel_sql_transaction_data (transaction_id, time, product_id) 
VALUES(153, '2016-01-06 08:57:52', 1),(91, '2016-01-07 12:17:27', 1),(31, '2016-01-05 13:19:25', 1),(24, '2016-01-03 10:47:44', 3),(4, '2016-01-06 17:57:42', 3),(163, '2016-01-03 10:11:22', 3),(92, '2016-01-08 12:03:20', 2),(32, '2016-01-04 19:37:14', 4),(253, '2016-01-06 14:15:20', 5),(118, '2016-01-06 14:27:33', 5);

## My Thought Process
To get the number of transactions for each product, I joined the two tables on product_id and then grouped the results by product_id. That allowed me to count how many transactions were recorded for each product.

## SQL Solution
```sql
SELECT i.product_id, i.product_name,count(t.transaction_id) as num_of_transactions
 FROM excel_sql_inventory_data as i
 JOIN excel_sql_transaction_data as t
   ON i.product_id = t.product_id
GROUP BY i.product_id;

```
## output
| product_id | product_name | num_of_transactions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | strawberry | 3 |
| 2 | apple_fuji | 1 |
| 3 | orange | 3 |
| 4 | clementines | 1 |
| 5 | blood_orange | 2 |
