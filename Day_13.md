# Day 13 – SQL Practice

## Problem Statement
𝐌𝐮𝐬𝐭 𝐓𝐫𝐲: Expedia, Airbnb (Basic Level) hashtag#SQL Interview Question — Solution

Find the number of rows for each review score earned by 'Hotel Arena'. Output the hotel name (which should be 'Hotel Arena'), review score along with the corresponding number of rows with that score for the specified hotel.

🔍 By solving this, you'll learn how to use join with grouping. Give it a try and share the output! 👇

𝐒𝐜𝐡𝐞𝐦𝐚 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚𝐬𝐞𝐭:
CREATE TABLE hotel_reviews (hotel_address VARCHAR(255),additional_number_of_scoring INT,review_date DATETIME,average_score FLOAT,hotel_name VARCHAR(100),reviewer_nationality VARCHAR(100),negative_review TEXT,review_total_negative_word_counts INT,total_number_of_reviews INT,positive_review TEXT,review_total_positive_word_counts INT,total_number_of_reviews_reviewer_has_given INT,reviewer_score FLOAT,tags VARCHAR(255),days_since_review VARCHAR(50),lat FLOAT,lng FLOAT);

INSERT INTO hotel_reviews (hotel_address, additional_number_of_scoring,review_date, average_score, hotel_name, reviewer_nationality,negative_review,review_total_negative_word_counts, total_number_of_reviews,positive_review,review_total_positive_word_counts, total_number_of_reviews_reviewer_has_given, reviewer_score, tags, days_since_review, lat, lng) VALUES('123 Main St', 5, '2024-01-01', 8.5, 'Hotel Arena', 'American', 'Noisy room', 3, 200, 'Great staff', 5, 10, 8.0, 'Family stay', '100 days', 40.7128, -74.0060),('123 Main St', 2, '2024-01-02', 8.5, 'Hotel Arena', 'British', 'Small bathroom', 2, 200, 'Clean room', 6, 5, 9.0, 'Solo traveler', '95 days', 40.7128, -74.0060),('123 Main St', 3, '2024-01-03', 8.5, 'Hotel Arena', 'Canadian', 'Slow service', 4, 200, 'Nice view', 7, 3, 6.0, 'Couple stay', '90 days', 40.7128, -74.0060);

## My Thought Process
To get the number of rows for each review score for Hotel Arena, I grouped the records by reviewer_score and used COUNT to see how many reviews fell into each score.

## SQL Solution
```sql

SELECT hotel_name, reviewer_score, count(reviewer_score)
  FROM hotel_reviews
 WHERE hotel_name = 'Hotel Arena'
 GROUP BY reviewer_score
 ORDER BY reviewer_score;

```
## Output

| hotel_name   | reviewer_score | count |
|--------------|----------------|-------|
| Hotel Arena  | 6.0            | 1     |
| Hotel Arena  | 8.0            | 1     |
| Hotel Arena  | 9.0            | 1     |

## 🎯Pattern: 
GROUP BY (Aggregation)

Why this pattern fits:

This pattern is used when you need to summarize data within a single table.

You group rows by a column (here: reviewer_score) and apply an aggregate function like COUNT() to see how many rows fall into each group.

This pattern is perfect for:

number of reviews per score

number of orders per day

number of users per country

number of products per category
